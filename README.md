# Demystifying async prograaming

A talk which dives into internals of async programming.

The intent was to demystify how event drive programming, reactive programming, futures in java, streaming and async programming in gRPC, nio libraries like netty, etc work. Uses rpc as an example to demonstrate, hence a small intro to RPC and REST.
